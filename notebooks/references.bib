    abstract    = { A decrease in maximal exercise heart rate (HRmax) is a key contributor to reductions in aerobic exercise capacity with aging. However, the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. We sought to gain insight into the respective roles of intrinsic heart rate (HRint) and chronotropic β-adrenergic responsiveness in the reductions in HRmax with aging in healthy adults. HRmax (Balke treadmill protocol to exhaustion), HRint (HR during acute ganglionic blockade with intravenous trimethaphan), and chronotropic β-adrenergic responsiveness (increase in HR with incremental intravenous infusion of isoproterenol during ganglionic blockade) were determined in 15 older (65 ± 5 yr) and 15 young (25 ± 4 yr) healthy men. In the older men, HRmax was lower (162 ± 9 vs. 191 ± 11 beats/min, P < 0.0001) and was associated with a lower HRint (58 ± 7 vs. 83 ± 9 beats/min, P < 0.0001) and chronotropic β-adrenergic responsiveness (0.094 ± 0.036 vs. 0.154 ± 0.045 ΔHR/[isoproterenol]: P < 0.0001). Both HRint (r = 0.87, P < 0.0001) and chronotropic β-adrenergic responsiveness (r = 0.61, P < 0.0001) were positively related to HRmax. Accounting for the effects of HRint and chronotropic β-adrenergic responsiveness reduced the age-related difference in HRmax by 83\%, rendering it statistically nonsignificant (P = 0.2). Maximal oxygen consumption was lower in the older men (34.9 ± 8.1 vs. 48.6 ± 6.7 ml·kg−1·min−1, P < 0.0001) and was positively related to HRmax (r = 0.62, P < 0.0001), HRint (r = 0.51, P = 0.002), and chronotropic β-adrenergic responsiveness (r = 0.47, P = 0.005). Our findings indicate that, together, reductions in HRint and chronotropic responsiveness to β-adrenergic stimulation largely explain decreases in HRmax with aging, with the reduction in HRint playing by far the greatest role. }

@article{disease_review,
    title    = "Ageing of the heart",
    author   = "Roffe, C",
    abstract = "Ageing of the heart is associated with a number of characteristic
              morphological, histological and biochemical changes. However, not
              all observed changes with age are associated with a deterioration
              in function. The high prevalence of hypertension and ischaemic
              heart disease makes distinction between normal ageing changes and
              the effects of underlying cardiovascular disease processes
              difficult. In this review, an attempt has been made to separate
              age-related changes from those related to disease, and to outline
              their significance for cardiac performance. Disease-independent
              changes in the ageing heart which are associated with a reduction
              in function include a reduction in the number of myocytes and
              cells within the specialised conduction tissue, the development
              of cardiac fibrosis, a reduction in calcium transport across
              membranes, lower capillary density and decreases in the
              intracellular response to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Other
              characteristic changes, such as epicardial fat deposition and
              'brown atrophy' due to intracellular lipofuscin deposits, appear
              to be merely symptomatic of the ageing process without any
              obvious effects on function. Some of the age-associated changes
              in the heart can be reversed, at least partially, by exercise or
              specific drugs. It remains, however, unclear whether this would
              result in any definite advantages for the individual. The
              mechanisms guiding proliferation or non-proliferation of myocytes
              and the development of fibrosis are current topics for research
              and may lead to new preventive approaches to ageing processes in
              the heart.",
