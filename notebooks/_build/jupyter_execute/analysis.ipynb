    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictors, `age`, `max_heart_rate`, and `rest_bp`, have high accuracy and a good chance of accurately predicting a patient's heart disease severity. However, some results indicate that these predictors may not be the best in actual practice. For instance, Figure 1. shows that these predictors do not have significant correlations with a diagnosis of severity of heart disease. Additionally, there was a significant drop-off after two neighbours in our $K$ graph, proposing that our accuracy results could be due to luck. However, our confusion matrix reveals promising results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is this what you expected to find?\n",
    "\n",
    "We expected to find that the larger the numerical value of a patient's age and resting blood pressure and the lower the maximum heart rate, the greater at risk a person is to have worsened heart disease. We actually found that these predictors have a weak correlation with the outcome variable. However, our model still predicts heart disease severity accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our confusion matrix in Figure 5., we were more likely to predict a false positive than a false negative. This is good because, with a health condition like heart disease that generates ranging severity, it is better to be given a false positive and be treated as if the disease were worse than be given a false negative and not be treated at all or to a lower care level than what is needed. A reason we see 18 false positives could be because of the predictors we chose to use in our model. We saw in Figure 1. that these predictors are not ideal because of the weak relationships they show with the severities of heart disease. This can also be said as to why we have 6 false negatives. However, considering that the accuracy of our model is good, this is a reasonable number of false negatives. These values for the false positives and false negatives also relate to our research question and conclusion that our selected predictors are primarily good at predicting the preliminary severity of a patient's heart disease. However, a diagnosis cannot be concluded off these factors alone. Unfortunately, false negatives and false positives are given in medicine in the real world, but from actual research and examples like we were able to display in our classification, it is more likely that a patient will have a proper diagnosis than a false positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What impact could such findings have?\n",
    "\n",
    "This could give medical professionals an idea that these predictors are good initial tests to check the severity of someone's heart disease, but further testing should be done to have a more accurate diagnosis. The severity levels of heart disease (0 to 4) are hard to distinguish between for our selected predictors, but they can be good indicators of a person having heart disease. This information can also be given to Government health care facilities as a precaution to provide public awareness and send letters to older citizens to check with a doctor on the status of their heart health. Also, individuals who feel they want to watch their heart health can compare their resting blood pressure, age and maximum heart rate with this model to estimate if they have heart disease and to what severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What future Questions could this lead to?\n",
    "\n",
    "What further research needs to be done on the predictors (maximum heart rate, age and resting blood pressure) to see if they are actually good predictors of heart disease? How could heart disease be lessened in the future, or how can heart disease be prevented? Patients at what age and with what symptoms should be encouraged to take precautions and see a doctor?"
