## Teamwork Contract


#### Communication: 										

Logistical discussions and minor issues will be communicated through Slack. All members are required to respond to group messages in less than 24 hours. However, it is expected that the group that messages will be replied to much sooner and that active discussion will happen through the platform. 

#### Team goals for the project:

Communicate clearly with group members so our final report is cohesive and follows one main idea by the end of the semester. Always be respectful and friendly. 

Work gradually throughout the semester; no cramming at the end or leaving work to the last minute.

Complete every task to the best of our abilities and reach out for help from the other team members when needed. 

Make sure to come to meeting once they are planned through Slack

#### Distribution of work fairly and equitably: 						

After scheduling a meeting through the group will meet and divide the work among the group members. All assignments must be made in consensus among all group members. Should a group member realize later that their assigned task requires more or less time commitment than the others, they shall inform the other group members on Slack and another meeting will be scheduled. 

#### Expected work:

If a team member encounters barriers and is not able to complete their work, then the member should give advance notice on the Slack group so that the assignment can be redistributed or a meeting scheduled.
											
#### Internal Deadlines: 

The group agrees to divide the work at each meeting. The assigned work reflects only the tasks that require completion before the subsequent meeting. The group agrees to divide the work equally throughout the weeks and to finalize all project deliverables one week before the assigned deadline. During that final week, checks, tests, and proofreading will take place to ensure that the deliverable is submitted correctly.
